				Enwrought with golden and silver light,<br />   
				The blue and the dim and the dark cloths<br />   
				Of night and light and the half light,<br />   
				I would spread the cloths under your feet:<br />
				But I, being poor, have only my dreams;<br />   
				I have spread my dreams under your feet;<br />   
				Tread softly because you tread on my dreams.<br /><br />
