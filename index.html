		<h1>Welcome to my webpage!</h1>
		<p>
			My name is Michael Foreman, and this is the initial version of my website. I am building this website from scratch using HTML and CSS. 
			I am hosting the code for this website using <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>. I will be making changes to the code 
			for the main page regularly as I work through the book I'm using and learn new techniques, so don't be surprised if for a while, 
			it looks different every time you visit the site. There is currently a link at the top of this page to where all of those pages exist, 
			and I plan to turn them into a tutorial when I'm finished with the book.
