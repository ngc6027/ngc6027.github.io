		<h1>Welcome to my webpage!</h1>
		<p>
			My name is Michael Foreman, and this is the initial version of my website. I am following the book "HTML & CSS" by Jon Duckett, which is
			an introduction to HTML5 and CSS3. I am hosting the code for this website using GitHub Pages. I will be making changes to the code for
			this website regularly as I work through the book, so new pages will be added that show the capabilites shown in each chapter.
			Bear in mind that since this isn't my first programming language, I'll be looking up ways to get more out of each chapter, so there
			may be things on the pages that don't directly correspond to the chapters. I will try to remember to add links to where I find those
			techniques as I use them.
			
			<br /><br />
			I will also be making an effort to make the HTML and CSS code easily readable by heavily utilizing indentation and white space in
			the code base, and I will leave these pages up in some form even after I'm done. This way, if you'd like to follow along with
			the book, you shouldn't have too much trouble figuring out what I've done by reading the source code for the website.

			Additionally, my brother Bradley is working on his own <a href="https://manik.space/">website</a> using a similar method.
			Feel free to visit his page as well.

		<p>
			I am currently a PhD Student at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, GA. I graduated with my B.S. in Electrical Engineering
			from Shippensburg University of Pennsylvania in 2018. Later, I will provide a link to the page for the research group I am currently
			involved with. For now, I will leave this section abridged until I have made more significant progress in this book.
