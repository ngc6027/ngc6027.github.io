		<h1>Welcome to my webpage!</h1>
		<p>
			My name is Michael Foreman, and this is the initial version of my website. I am following the book "HTML & CSS" by Jon Duckett, which is an introduction to HTML5 and CSS3. I am hosting the code for this website using GitHub Pages. I will be making changes to the code for this website using different branches, so the updates may be slow at first while I work through the book.

		<h2>About me</h2>

		<p>
			I am currently a PhD Student at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, GA. I graduated with my B.S. in Electrical Engineering from Shippensburg University of Pennsylvania in 2018. Later, I will provide a link to the page for the research group I am currently involved with. For now, I will leave this section abridged until I have made more significant progress in this book.
