		<h1>Learning HTML and CSS Concepts</h1>
		
		<p>
			This section of the site shows my journey learning HTML and CSS to build this site. I am following the book <cite>HTML & CSS: Design
			and Build Websites</cite> by Jon Duckett, which is an introduction to HTML5 and CSS3. I will be making changes to the code for this website regularly as I work through the book, so new pages will be added that show the capabilites shown in each chapter. Bear in mind
			that since this isn't my first programming language, I'll be looking up ways to get more out of each chapter, so there may be things on
			the pages that don't directly correspond to the chapters. I will try to remember to add links to where I find those techniques as I use
			them.
			
			<br /><br />
			I will also be making an effort to make the HTML and CSS code easily readable by heavily utilizing indentation and white space in
			the code base, and I will leave these pages up in some form even after I'm done. This way, if you'd like to follow along with
			the book, you shouldn't have too much trouble figuring out what I've done by reading the source code for the website.
